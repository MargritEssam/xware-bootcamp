        <h2>Dr. Magdi Yacoub | MY HERO</h2>
        <h3>Hello I will talk about the life of Dr. Magdi Yacoub. He's the most famous heart surgeon in the world. He was born at 16 November 1935 in Assuite. When he was 5 years old, he said "I want to be a surgeon" because his father was a surgeon and his aunt died at 20 years old because she was sick from her heart. Doctor Magdi Yacoub said : "Many people need treatment for this problem, I will be a heart surgeon to help people". He was educated in Cairo University. Now he is working at Imperial College in London.</h3>
        
        <h3>I want Dr. Magdi Yacoub to be my hero because he worked hard to be a surgeon as he wanted when he was a young. I want to be a doctor, a very famous doctor, like Dr. Magdi Yacoub. He took the title of Sir and he's the first Egyptian to receive the Order of Merit. I am working and studying hard to be a doctor like my hero. I finished my paragraph and thanks for your listening. I hope for everyone to have a hero and to be in future like their hero.</h3>
